### johnjohn's Hangman

This is a Hangman game implementation for a code club I'm involved in. It is meant both as an example for other members to compare their work against, and as a Python refresher for myself

Foul language and unrobust non-pythonic garbage ahead - heed this warning if you are offended by a PG-13 allotment of S-bombs and obscene use of `global`

### Usage
`wordlist` is a file containing the words used for the game
A hint system is not yet implemented
To start the game:
`python jjhangman`
and follow prompts on the screen

### Troubleshooting
You're on your own lol

### License
See `LICENSE` for the (lack of) terms of using this heaping pile of doodoo in another project

### Additional notes
Made with ❤️ (or whatever) by a deranged Floridian
